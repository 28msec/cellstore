# CellStore

In traditional data warehousing, it takes months for the IT department to build a single hypercube.
With the CellStore, it takes minutes for the business users to build an infinite number of hypercubes.

The CellStore is entirely written in JSONiq and is hosted on 28.io.
A deployment can be easily customized to your own needs.
An example of such deployment with SEC filings is available at [secxbrl.info](http://app.secxbrl.info).
